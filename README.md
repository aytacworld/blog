# Aytacworld Blog

This project contains the source files of my personal blog.

The main goal of this project is to be fully compatible with Lynx Browser. However if you browse it using a regular browser(Chrome, Firefox), it will use minimal css.

Backend is written in javascript using node. Frontend will not include any javascript at all. So the website will also work when javascript is disabled.

If you like it you can clone the repo and start using it for your own blog.

## TODO
